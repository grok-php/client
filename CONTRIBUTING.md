## Running Tests
1. To run **PHPUnit**, you should copy the `phpunit.xml.dist` file to `phpunit.xml`.

```sh
cp phpunit.xml.dist phpunit.xml
```

2. **Update** the API key in `phpunit.xml` with your actual API key:
```xml
<php>
    <env name="GROK_API_KEY" value="your-grok-api-key-here"/>
</php>
```
3. **Obtain an API Key:**  
   If you don‚Äôt have an API key, sign up at [Grok AI](https://x.ai/api/) and create one.

4. **Run the tests with PHPUnit:**
```sh
composer test
```
Or run **PHPUnit** manually:
```sh
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

‚úÖ If all tests pass, your PR is good to go!

‚ùå If tests fail, debug the issue before pushing changes.
